MARKETPLACE QUERY FIX

The error is in your food_donation/views.py file around line 466-467. The query for marketplace items has improper backslashes and indentation.

BAD CODE (DO NOT USE):
```python
items = MarketplaceItem.objects.filter(status='available')\\
.select_related('seller')\
```

GOOD CODE (USE THIS):
```python
items = MarketplaceItem.objects.filter(status='available').select_related('seller')
```

OR EVEN BETTER (WITH PROPER LINE BREAKS):
```python
items = (
    MarketplaceItem.objects.filter(status='available')
    .select_related('seller')
    .prefetch_related('images')
    .order_by('-created_at')
)
```

To fix this in your views.py file, follow these steps:

1. Open the file in an editor:
   ```
   nano food_donation/views.py
   ```

2. Find the problematic code (around line 466)

3. Replace it with the correct version

4. Save the file (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X in nano)

5. Run migrations:
   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

The issue is that Python's line continuation with backslashes must not have any characters (not even spaces) after the backslash. Using parentheses for multi-line expressions is cleaner and less error-prone.
